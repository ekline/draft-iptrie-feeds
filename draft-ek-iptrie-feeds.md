# Introduction

TODO Introduction

<!--

* mention:
  * geofeed finder
  * geofeeds study
* Since 8805 several requests have been received over the years:
  * more extensible format than CSV [cite RFC]
  * richer expression of geographic regions
  * more canonical sources of geograhic names (geonames.org?)
  * some kinds of guarantees for anonymity
  * locations not on Earth
  * support for anycast
  * additional attributes like "end site prefixes"
  * remove all mention of ill-fated, ill-conceived Postal Code
* restress "best effort"
* inline attestations?
* primary attribute in the IP Trie is "geo"
* multiple feeds representing different views of the same data
  * feed for public consumption might be very different from a feed served to Emergency Services consumers (or org-internal consumers)
